# Unsupervised_ML_Algo

This repository contains implementations of unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Although logistic regression is generally considered a supervised learning algorithm, this repository provides a unique perspective by including it in an unsupervised context. The repository uses a dataset consisting of `train.csv`, `test.csv`, and `test_results.csv` for training, testing, and evaluating the models respectively.

## Introduction

This repository aims to provide a unique implementation of logistic regression in an unsupervised learning context. It demonstrates how logistic regression, typically a supervised learning algorithm, can be adapted and applied for clustering or other unsupervised tasks.

## Algorithm

### Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is generally used for binary classification problems. In this repository, we explore its application in an unsupervised setting, demonstrating its adaptability beyond traditional supervised learning tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this repository includes:
- `train.csv`: Contains the training data used to fit the model.
- `test.csv`: Contains the testing data used to evaluate the model.
- `test_results.csv`: Contains the expected results for the test data to calculate accuracy.


## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request for any improvements or additions.
